                <h3 class="newton-laws">First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia):</h3>
                    <li class="statement-nl">A body resting will continue to rest, and a body in motion will continue to move, unless a force from outside the system is applied.</li>
                    <li class="explanmation-nl">The law describes the law of inertia or the resistance of bodies to changes in their state of motion. For example, when you push a book on a table, it will stop because of friction (outside force).</li>
                    <h3 class="newton-laws">Second Law of Motion (F = ma):</h3>
                    <li class="statement-nl">The force applied to a thing is equal to the mass of the thing multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).</li>
                    <li class="explanmation-nl">This law defines the way the velocity of an object is changed when a force is applied. The bigger the force applied to an object, the more it will accelerate. The heavier the object, the lesser the acceleration with a particular force. For example, it will cause a car to accelerate less than when a bicycle is pushed with the same force.</li>
                <h3 class="newton-laws">Third Law of Motion (Action and Reaction):</h3>
                    <li class="statement-nl">The force applied to a thing is equal to the mass of the thing multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).</li>
                    <li class="explanmation-nl">This law defines the way the velocity of an object is changed when a force is applied.

            <h1>Motions</h1>
            <h3>Acceleration:</h3>
                <p>Acceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity changes with time. It tells us how quickly an object speeds up or slows down.</p>
                <li>Formula:
                    <p>a = Δt/Δv</p>
                    <li style="margin: 10px;">a is acceleration</li>
                    <li style="margin: 10px;">v is the change in velocity</li>
                    <li style="margin: 10px;">t is time</li>
                    <p>Units: The SI unit of acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s²).<br><br>Acceleration due to Gravity:
                        Near Earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately
                        9.8m/s^2(downward).
                       
                        </p>
                    <p>Types of Acceleration:</p>
                        <li>Uniform Acceleration: Acceleration that does not change over time (e.g., a car accelerating at a constant rate).</li>
                        <li>Acceleration: Acceleration that changes over time.</li>
                </li>
            <h3>Deceleration:</h3>
                <li>Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration. It is a phenomenon that occurs when the velocity of an object decreases. It is simply a negative acceleration.</li>
                <li>Formula:
                    <p>a = Δt/Δv</p>
                    <li style="margin: 10px;">a is acceleration</li>
                    <li style="margin: 10px;">v is the change in velocity</li>
                    <li style="margin: 10px;">t is time</li>
                    <p>The same formula applies as for acceleration, but deceleration occurs when the velocity decreases.</p>

            <h1 class="friction-t">Friction</h1>
            <h4 class="friction-def">The force that opposes the relative motion or propensity for such motion between two surfaces in contact is known as friction. It happens when two bodies try to slip past one another. In daily activities like walking, driving, and even operating machinery, friction is essential.</h4>
            <h3 class="typ-fric">Types of Friction:</h3>
                <li class="stat-fric">Static Friction:<br>This is the frictional force that resists the initiation of sliding motion between two surfaces. When you try to push a heavy box on the ground, static friction prevents the box from moving in the beginning. Once enough force is applied, static friction is overcome, and the box begins to move.</li><br>
                <li class="kin-fric">Kinetic (Dynamic) Friction:<br>When two surfaces are moving, this frictional force prevents them from sliding over one another. Kinetic friction is the force that stops the box from moving as soon as it begins. It is typically smaller than static friction, which makes it simpler to maintain motion than to initiate it.</li><br>
                <li class="roll-fric">Rolling Friction:<br>When an object (such a wheel or ball) rolls across a surface, this happens. the resistance of a rolling tyre to the pavement. Compared to static and kinetic friction, rolling friction is typically substantially less.</li>

            <h1 class="flem-t">Fleming's Laws</h1>
            <h4 class="flem-def">Two key ideas that explain how electric motors and generators behave in relation to motion, electric current, and magnetic fields are Fleming's Laws. These rules aid in the explanation of how motors operate and how magnetic fields are used to create electricity. Generally, Fleming's laws are divided into two sections:</h4>
            <h4 class="flem-1">1. Fleming's Left-Hand Rule (for Motors):</h4>
                <li class="flem-1-def">This rule is used to determine the direction of motion of a conductor (like a wire) in a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through it. It helps explain the working principle of electric motors.<br><br>Thumb: Represents the direction of motion (or the force applied on the conductor). <br>Index Finger: Represents the direction of the magnetic field (from north to south). <br>Middle Finger: Represents the direction of the electric current (from positive to negative).</li>
            <h4 class="flem-2">2. Fleming's Right-Hand Rule (for Generators):</h4>
                <li class="flem-2-def">This rule is used to determine the direction of the induced current when a conductor moves through a magnetic field. It explains the working principle of generators.<br><br>Thumb: Represents the direction of motion of the conductor (or the movement of the coil in the magnetic field).<br>Index Finger: Represents the direction of the magnetic field (from north to south).<br>Middle Finger: Represents the direction of the induced current.</li>

            <h1 class="wav-t">Waves</h1>
            <h4 class="wav-def">A wave is a disturbance or oscillation that transfers energy through a medium or space, without transferring matter. Waves can carry energy over long distances, such as sound waves traveling through air or electromagnetic waves traveling through space.</h4>
            <h3 class="typ-wav">Types of waves</h3>
                <h4 class="mech-t">Mechanical Waves:</h4>
                <p class="mech">These waves require a medium (like air, water, or solids) to travel through. They cannot propagate in a vacuum.<br><br>Mechanical waves can be further divided into:
                    <li style="margin: 25px;">Transverse Waves: The particles of the medium move perpendicular to the direction of the wave's motion.
                    Example: Waves on a string or water waves.</li>
                    <li style="margin: 25px;">Longitudinal Waves: The particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave's motion.
                    Example: Sound waves in air.</li>
                    </p>
                <h4 class="elec-t">Electromagnetic Waves:</h4>
                <p class="elec">These waves do not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum (space). They are oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space.</p>
